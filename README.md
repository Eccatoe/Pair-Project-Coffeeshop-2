Pair Project Coffeeshop


Welcome to the JavaShop(get it?)
Our Flatiron School Phase 1 pair programming project, done via vanilla JavaScript. 

Some Exciting Features: 
-db json array of drinks with images appearing on the front page
- a custom drink form where a user can create and add a drink to the menu, which also posts to the db JSON
- user can add drinks to cart and delete drinks from cart, cart total is updated to reflect current price based on user changes
- user is able to delete their custom drinks to from the menu via a trash button, the drink is then removed from the menu in db JSON
- when a user clicks on any drink on the menu, a modal card pops up which allows them to edit their drink (sizes and flavors)
- CSS layout made using primarily CSS grid, modal displayed with a fixed position. Shadowboxing added for dimension. Escape keydown function with ability to close the modal
- Cool function on line 126 allows for an item to be added to cart conditionally by both click and submit events :)
